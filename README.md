# Correlation_SP500


Collecting and saving S&P500 stock information locally (had to scrape ticker data from wikipedia using the requests and beautifulsoup4 modules) and then 
doing analysis which involves creating a candle stick chart and finally calculating a correlation DataFrame between all 505 companies listed on the S&P500.
